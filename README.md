One key difference between MySQL and MongoDB is how they manage code in their database. MySQL is a relational database that stores data in structured tables with predefined schemas. Every record must conform to this structure or otherwise, the code fails. However, MongoDB is a flexible database and stores data in JSON-like documents. Each document can have different embedded in the other databases, but this makes the code easier to run.


An example where MongoDB would excel is managing clinical documentation and medical imaging metadata together. Imaging comes in many different formats and structures, making it hard for them to be stored in a fixed schema. MongoDB’s document-oriented structure allows each patient record, such as text notes, URLs, metadata, images, and lab results to be in the same document.
